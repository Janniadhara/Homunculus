  description: This small glass vial contains a bubbling green liquid that looks
    almost like liquid grass. The liquid has a spicy aroma that makes your nose tingle,
    and when you drink it, you feel a surge of energy that seems to come from deep
    within your muscles. Your body feels light and nimble, and you're ready to take
    on any challenge.
