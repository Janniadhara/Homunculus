  description: This small glass vial contains a shimmering blue liquid that seems
    to pulse with magical energy. The liquid has a faint, sweet aroma that reminds
    you of a distant memory, and when you drink it, you feel a tingling sensation
    that spreads throughout your body. Your mind clears, and you feel ready to cast
    more spells.
