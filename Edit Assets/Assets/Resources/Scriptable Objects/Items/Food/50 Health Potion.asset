  description: This small glass vial contains a bubbling, bright green liquid that
    looks both refreshing and potent. The liquid has a slightly sweet aroma and a
    faint glow that seems to pulse with healing energy. When you drink it, you feel
    a surge of vitality and your wounds begin to close up.
