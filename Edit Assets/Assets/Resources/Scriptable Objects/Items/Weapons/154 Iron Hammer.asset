  description: This sturdy sword is made of solid iron and has a straight blade that's
    sharpened to a fine edge. The hilt is wrapped in a rough leather grip that provides
    a firm hold, even in sweaty or bloody hands. When you swing the sword, you feel
    its weight and balance, and hear the satisfying whoosh of air as it cuts through
    the air.
